# Project Color Addition Explanation: (Jasan)
**Why**
<br>
- Added color onto the world. Essentially by adding the color, it helped
to shape and envision the world as a proper landscape. 

**World Background**
<br>
- Breaking it down height by height, anything below a suitable height was darkened, so that
the edges remained looking 'seamless' (6). 

**World Rivers/Streams**
<br>
- Anything past or equal to a height of (8) on our geometric map would begin to create streams marked by a nice deep blue,
adding onto that anything past or equal to (10) would introduce a richer blue hue to that.

**World Grass/Foliage**
<br>
- Anything past or equal to a height of (14) would introduce an earthy green which would be enhanced 
by anything past or equal to a height of (18) that would introduce a more muddier green to add richness and
depth to the grassy parts.

**World Mountains**
<br>
- Anything past or equal to a height of (30) would create the beginnings of a mountain, particulary the hillside,
where it would introduce a light grey. Adding onto that, anything past or equal to a height of (41) would shape
the hue of that grey into a more smokey and traditional mountainside grey, that would be seen more near to the summit.

**World Peaks**
<br>
- Anything past or equal to a height of (47) would create the beginnings of an icey and snowy peak/mountain top. 
If the height is anything higher than the creation point of the icey/snowy hue then it would automatically default
to a snow white. This would create the perfect illusion of a snowy peaked top onto our geometry map to complete the terrain.
